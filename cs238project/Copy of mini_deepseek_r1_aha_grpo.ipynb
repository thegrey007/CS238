If I subtract 70 from 80, I get 10 again, this isn't constructive yet.\n","Multiplication could create numbers larger than the target 85. Let's consider division: If I divide 70 by 14, I get 5.

Let me correct my approach: Let's use division and then addition. If I take 80 / (70 / 14) → 80 / 5 = 16, and then 80 - 16 = 64, still incorrect. Let me simplify: 80 / (70 / 14) → 80 / 5 = 16, and then 80 - 16 gives 64 again, let me correct: 80 - (70 / 14) → 80 - 5 = 75, but I need 85.

Now, if I add 1 to 90, I get 91, which is also not right. Another way is to see what happens if I subtract 21 from 90, which gives me 69. This is closer but still not 68. Let me use multiplication instead of subtraction. 90 * 1 = 90. Now, if I try to reduce this slightly by subtracting 21, I am not getting close to 68.\n","Now, let's try another multiplication. I'll think of 1 * (larger value) + (smaller value). Let's try 1 * 90 + 21. This evaluates to 90 + 21 = 111, which is too much. Instead, I will try: 90 / 1 + 21 - 7. But this gives a division by 7, which seems complex. Let's re-evaluate: I'll use 1 to divide 21: 21 / 1 = 21.

Just a week after DeepSeek release, we've been able to reproduce a simple version of R1 learned \"reasoning\" using GRPO and the Countdown Game. While our implementation focuses on a specific task rather than general reasoning and convergence into a very specific \"reasoning\" format, it shows that the method is working.\n","\n","In our mini R1 experiment we used GRPO, with two rule-based reward but already required significant compute: 4 H100 GPUs running for 6 hours to complete just 450 training steps on a 3B parameter model. This gives us an idea of the compute needs that you will need to scale Reinforcement Learning. Deepseek ran a 671B model for over 8000 steps and they probably did many ablations.\n","\n","Looking in to 2025, it's clear that we are on the cusp of even more significant progress. RL will become more accessible and user-friendly, more researchers and developers will explore its potential, but also require amount of more compute as before and compared to supervised fine-tuning.\n","\n","I am excited for 2025.
